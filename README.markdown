# Smarty plugin for Vim

This plugin provides syntax highlighting, indenting and general filetype settings for the Smarty templating language.

This is a fork of [Vim Script #1798](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1798)
(see the original README below).

## Enhancements

The following (probably incomplete) list of enhancements are provided:

* Various improvements throughout the syntax handling.
* `{php}â€¦{/php}` blocks are delegated to PHP syntax.
* `filetype` is set to "smarty" for `*.tpl` files.
* syntax is based on HTML filetype.
* matchit (jumping between tags via `%`) is configured for Smarty tags
  (`{foo}` .. `{/foo}`), and based on the html setup.
* line endings have been converted to unix fileformat (to prevent
  parse errors on Linux/Mac).
* Smarter indenting, handling PHP blocks and delegating to HTML (includes
  JavaScript).
* Syntax updated to Smarty5
* add doc for variable configuration
* unit tests

## Installation

If you use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), add the following lines
to your `~/.vimrc`:

```vim
Plugin 'shadowwa/smarty.vim'
```

Then run inside Vim:

```vim
:so ~/.vimrc
:PluginInstall
```

If you use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), do this:

```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/shadowwa/smarty.vim.git
```

For [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) users:

```vim
Plug 'shadowwa/smarty.vim'
```

in your `.vimrc` or `init.vim`, then restart Vim and run `:PlugInstall`.

## Variables

### indenting

When this variable is set, the indentation is done on html tags and smarty
tags otherwise smarty tags are not indented

```vim
let g:smarty_indent_block = 1
```

```smarty
 <div>
     <span>
         {if $test}
             {$variable}
         {/if}
     </span>
 </div>
```

```vim
    let g:smarty_indent_block = 0
```

```smarty
 <div>
     <span>
         {if $test}
         {$variable}
         {/if}
     </span>
 </div>
```

### Verbose mode for debugging

```vim
    let g:smarty_indent_verbose = 1
```

## Testing

Testing is based on vader.vim testing framework, see:
<https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim> . To run full test suit use
`./test/run-tests.sh`, this will also download vader.vim plugin to project's
folder.

## Original README

This is a mirror of <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1798>

A friend and I found that there were no acceptable vim syntax files for smarty, so we took the only one we could find and added everything from the smarty documentation (<http://smarty.php.net/manual/en>) to it.  If nothing else, this is a very good start on a complete smarty syntax file.  We have even used vimtip #498 to use autocomplete with this syntax and so far it seems to work well.
