*smarty.txt*                                                Syntax highlighting

This plugin provides syntax highlighting, indenting and general filetype
settings for the Smarty templating language.
https://smarty-php.github.io/.

The following (probably incomplete) list of enhancements are provided:

 * Various improvements throughout the syntax handling.
 * `{php}â€¦{/php}` blocks are delegated to PHP syntax.
 * `filetype` is set to "smarty" for `*.tpl` files.
 * syntax is based on HTML filetype.
 * matchit (jumping between tags via `%`) is configured for Smarty tags
   (`{foo}` .. `{/foo}`), and based on the html setup.
 * line endings have been converted to unix fileformat (to prevent parse
   errors on Linux/Mac).
 * Smarter indenting, handling PHP blocks and delegating to HTML (includes
   JavaScript).
